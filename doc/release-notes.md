# Dash Core version v20.1.0

This is a new minor version release, including various new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

This release is optional but recommended for all nodes.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues>


# Upgrading and downgrading

## How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
dashd/dash-qt (on Linux).

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < v19.2.0

Downgrading to a version older than v19.2.0 is not supported due to changes
in the evodb database. If you need to use an older version, you must either
reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

# Notable changes

## HD Wallets Enabled by Default

In this release, we are taking a significant step towards enhancing the Dash wallet's usability by enabling Hierarchical
Deterministic (HD) wallets by default. This change aligns the behavior of `dashd` and `dash-qt` with the previously
optional `-usehd=1` flag, making HD wallets the standard for all users.

While HD wallets are now enabled by default to improve user experience, Dash Core still allows for the creation of
non-HD wallets by using the `-usehd=0` flag. However, users should be aware that this option is intended for legacy
support and will be removed in future releases. Importantly, even with an HD wallet, users can still import non-HD
private keys, ensuring flexibility in managing their funds.

## Configuration option changes

## RPC changes

- `protx info`: It's now possible to get historical data at a specific block by providing its blockhash.
- RPC `gettxchainlocks` will also return the status `mempool` indicating whether the transaction is in the mempool 
or not.
- Exposed transaction version numbers are now treated as unsigned 16-bit integers instead of signed 16-bit integers.
This matches their treatment in consensus logic. Versions greater than 3 continue to be non-standard (matching previous
behavior of smaller than 1 or greater than 3 being non-standard). Note that this includes the joinpsbt command, which
combines partially-signed transactions by selecting the highest version number.
- New RPC `getrawtransactionmulti` that can return batch up to 100 raw transactions at one request.
- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now returns a `connection_type` field. This indicates the type of connection established with
the peer. It will return one of six options. For more information, see the `getpeerinfo` help documentation.
- The `getpeerinfo` RPC now has additional `last_block` and `last_transaction` fields that return the UNIX epoch time
of the last block and the last valid transaction received from each peer. (#19731)
- `getblockchaininfo` now returns a new `time` field, that provides the chain tip time.
- `fundrawtransaction` and `walletcreatefundedpsbt` when used with the `lockUnspents` argument now lock manually
selected coins, in addition to automatically selected coins. Note that locked coins are never used in automatic coin
selection, but can still be manually selected.
- The `testmempoolaccept` RPC returns `vsize` and a `fee` object with the `base` fee if the transaction passes
validation. The `testmempoolaccept` RPC now accepts multiple transactions (still experimental at the moment, API may be
unstable).

## Added RPCs

- `submitchainlock` RPC allows the submission of a ChainLock signature. Note: This RPC is whitelisted for the Platform
RPC user.
- `getassetunlockstatuses` RPC allows fetching of Asset Unlock txs by their withdrawal index. The RPC accepts an array
of indexes and an optional block height. The possible outcomes per each index are: `chainlocked`, `mined`, `mempooled`,
`unknown`. Note: If a specific block height is passed on request, then only `chainlocked` and `unknown` outcomes are
possible. This RPC is whited for the Platform RPC user.
- `quorum dkginfo` RPC returns information about DKGs: `active_dkgs` and `next_dkg`.

## Docker Build System

Modified the Dockerfile to exclude the `dash-qt` graphical wallet interface from the set of binaries copied to
`/usr/local/bin` during the Docker image build process. This change streamlines the Docker image, making it more
suitable for server environments and headless applications, where the graphical user interface of `dash-qt` is not
required. The update enhances the Docker image's efficiency by reducing its size and minimizing unnecessary components.

## Command-line options

The same ZeroMQ notification (e.g. `-zmqpubhashtx=address`) can now be specified multiple times to publish the same
notification to different ZeroMQ sockets.

## Notification changes

- `-walletnotify` notifications are now sent for wallet transactions that are removed from the mempool because they
conflict with a new block. These notifications were sent previously before the v18.1 release, but had been broken since
that release.
- The `startupnotify` option is used to specify a command to execute when Dash Core has finished with its startup
sequence.

## Build System

The `--enable-upnp-default` and `--enable-natpmp-default` options have been removed. If you want to use port mapping,
you can configure it using a `.conf` file, or by passing the relevant options at runtime.

## Wallet

- The wallet can create a transaction without change even when the keypool is empty. Previously it failed.

## Backports from Bitcoin Core

This release introduces many updates from Bitcoin  v0.20-v25.0. Breaking changes are documented here; however, for
additional detail on whatâ€™s included in Bitcoin, please refer to their release notes.
